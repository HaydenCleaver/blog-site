# blog-site

- Author: Hayden Cleaver

## Description

This will be a fully functional blog/forum for games, and will likely grow to encompass the topic of movies, books, and other forms of entertainment.  

It will have a main page that displays news/blog posts regarding the form of entertainment that you have selected.

There will also be a series of forums where people can create their own topics for discussion and users can upvote or downvote topics like stackoverflow, Reddit, or other similar sites.  Users will be able to sort topics by upvotes or how new the post is.

## Goals

The aim is to continue learning about Next.js and to improve my style skills.  The site will likely only be deployed for proof of life.
